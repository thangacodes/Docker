Docker (Multi-Stage Build):

This project uses a multi-stage Dockerfile to keep the final image small and secure by separating the build environment from the runtime environment.

Build the Docker Image:-

Build the Docker image from the Dockerfile:

docker build -t webimage .


Note: Replace webimage with your preferred image name if needed.

Run the Container:-

Run a container from the built image and expose port 5000:

docker run -p 5000:5000 --name webapp webimage


webimage → image name
webapp → container name

Application will be available at:
http://localhost:5000

View Container Logs:-

To tail logs from the running container:

docker logs --tail 200 -f webapp

Final Notes:

Ensure the Flask app runs on 0.0.0.0 and port 5000

Port mapping used: 5000:5000 (host → container)
